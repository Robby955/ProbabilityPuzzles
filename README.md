# Exploring the Monty Hall and Birthday Problem with Simulations
A look at Monty Hall and the Birthday Problem via simulations in R.

Introduction:
In this article, we'll explore two classical problems in probability - the Monty Hall Problem and the Birthday Problem- and we will use R simulations to visualize and verify the surprising results. 
Simulations are an extremely powerful tool in statistics and Data Science as they can be used to verify results practically.
We'll also provide interactive Shiny apps and links to the GitHub with the full code so you can run it yourself.
Try it yourself using my interactive Shiny Applications.
